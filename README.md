Todo
------

As foreign-fetch is not supported, caching api calls is not feasible while
 the api is on a different origin 

- ~~Failover server requests to cache~~
- Update service worker on new version


Member
------

Member is a Bitcoin Cash blockchain browser. It reads and allows users to create actions in the Memo/Member protocol.
Notably it displays and creates posts, likes, tips, profiles, reputational ratings and geolocated posts.
It is designed to be a 'fat' javascript client app that runs against a relatively dumb server. 
You can see it online here - https://memberapp.github.io


Client
------
The client is an HTML5/JS BCH blockchain browser app with no outside js dependencies. It can be run from a website, or from a local file system. (Brave/Edge browsers do not allow local storage, so Firefox/Chrome recommended)

It connects to a Member server to get content and broadcast transactions. It can also get utxos from a Member server if that server has a BCHD utxo index. Otherwise it gets utxos from Bitbox

Projects

->New CSS designs

->Security review

-->Review handling of private keys, assess for XSS vulnerabilities, make recommendations for improvements

->Bug tracker

-->List of issues on https://github.com/memberapp/memberapp.github.io/issues, many are client only.

Server
------

The server currently consists of

Node.js program with option of MySQL or SQLite Database
Requires BCHD or Bitcoin Unlimited Node (other node software untested yet)

Testing
-------

->Regularly using Member from the perspective of a new user and reporting bugs and problems
->Using Member as a regular user and reporting bugs and problems
->Collecting bug reports from forums etc and entering them in the github bug tracking system.


Desktop App
-----------

The app will package a BCH node (BCHD), Server and Client. It should allow one click install and setup.

Projects

->Create User Friendly installer for various platforms
->Update BCHD to support utxoindex with fastsync 

Mobile Apps
-----------

Mobile apps will rely on a remote server. This might be a server provided by Member, or the member's own server.

Projects

->Iphone app

->Android app

Hosting
-------

->A host with good capacity and DDOS protection would be helpful to the project.
